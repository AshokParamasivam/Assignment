	Way of approach to the assignment:

	Network calls: Retrofit library used to make api network calls.
	Data binding : used to avoid boilerplate code to refer the views and assign the values.
	Design pattern : Model View Viewmodel (MVVM) used to seperate the UI logic from business logic, making code clean and maintainable.
	Kotlin Coroutines used along with retorfit to make the network calls.
	Error handling : Kotlin exception handler added to catch the exception while api calls.
	Network connection status: In case of user mobile phone not connected to the network, message will be displayed at the bottom of the screen.
